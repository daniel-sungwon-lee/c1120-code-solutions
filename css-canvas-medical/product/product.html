        <h1>It's the foundation for patient-centered primary care.</h1>
        <p>
          Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across
          clinicians, staff, and patients themselves &mdash; making you more
          productive, less stressed, and asking just a bit more joy into your
          practice of medicine.

            bounce around five windows to discover the last blood count.
            Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your note, so
            you never have to leave it. And because Canvas learns from every
            interaction, it gets smarter with every patient you see.

            technology to actually improve quality of care I provide."

            to give it to them. Easily reach out to any subgroup of your population

            ahead.

            like a lot to ask and those are tremendously important questions. But
            I just couldn't get an answer from our old system! Canvas is light-years

            Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand
            performance, but they aren't enough to improve quality and increase
            revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality protocols and charge
            capture so clinicians can focus on more complex work only they can do.

            small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of coders
            to catch everything. The automation in Canvas has completely eliminated
            my concerns around quality and revenue performance."
