            Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across
            clinicians, staff, and patients themselves &mdash; making you more
            productive, less stressed, and asking just a bit more joy into your
            practice of medicine.

            Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your note, so
            you never have to leave it. And because Canvas learns from every
            interaction, it gets smarter with every patient you see.

            like a lot to ask and those are tremendously important questions. But

            revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality protocols and charge
            capture so clinicians can focus on more complex work only they can do.

            small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of coders
            to catch everything. The automation in Canvas has completely eliminated
            my concerns around quality and revenue performance."
