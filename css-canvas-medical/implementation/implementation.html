          <h1>Canvas will be the second best investment you've ever made, guaranteed.</h1>
          <p>
            Becoming a physician will endure as your all-time best investment
            decision, and on behalf of your community, we're grateful for it.
            When you choose to invest in Canvas, we'll ensure you list Canvas
            as the second best investment you've ever made for your practice,
            guaranteed. Contact us when you're ready to discuss the details.

          <li>Making the Decision to Switch</li>
          <p class="list-text">
            You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined
            that we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on
            investment. Our goal is to give you as much information as possible
            to make this determination one way or the other. We will provide access
            to a sandbox of the Canvas application for you to get a feel for the
            platform as well as references to current customers to talk about
            their experience.
          </p>
          <li>Interfaces and Community Integration</li>
          <p class="list-text">
            Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community
            resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax number, enrolling
            your payers with our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds
            running. We'll also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers
            into Canvas so that sending referrals and closing loops is seamless.
            Finally, if interfaces with health information exchanges or other information
            technology vendors are important, we will work with you to determine
            what we can deliver and when.
          </p>
          <li>Data Migration</li>
          <p class="list-text">
            The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your
            current data, which we have executed successfully with both remotely
            hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Then our work begins to import
            into Canvas. Patient demographics and information like medications,
            problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward. While importing
            clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team has been
            able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.
          </p>
          <li>Training and Site Visit</li>
          <p class="list-text">
            We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical
            content, charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be
            done a few weeks prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members
            with clinical, practice management, and billing workflows. Either before
            or during go-live, one of our team can visit your practice to work
            side-by-side with you on implementation and training.
          </p>
          <li>Go-Live and Tuning</li>
          <p class="list-text">
            Go-Live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice.
            We will be with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your
            preference, to make sure everything goes smoothly. There is always fine
            tuning to do once you have a handful of encounters in Canvas under your
            belt: changing clinical microtemplates, setting up new automations,
            modifying practice management settings, and more. We are here to help
            with it all.
          </p>
          <li>Sustained Performance</li>
          <p class="list-text">
            All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises
            and provide support over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means
            that if we are not meeting expectations, you can terminate the agreement
            and receive all payments back. (We do not expect this to happen). For
            our Standard plans, we also offer a MIPS guarantee: if you receive a
            negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for everyone, we provide
            unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a long, productive
            partnership for us both.
